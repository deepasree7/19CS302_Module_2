## AIM:
To write a C Program to print the string "KEYBOARD" n number of times.

## Algorithm
1. Start
2. Declare an integer variable n
3. Read the value of n from the user
4. Repeat a loop from 1 to n
5. Print the string "KEYBOARD" inside the loop
6. End  

## Program:
#include <stdio.h>

int main()

{

int n, i;

printf("Enter how many times you want to print KEYBOARD: ");
    
scanf("%d", &n);

for(i = 1; i <= n; i++) {

printf("KEYBOARD\n");

}

return 0;

}

## Output:
